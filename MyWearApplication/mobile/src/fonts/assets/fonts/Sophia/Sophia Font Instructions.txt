Sophia - instructions for alternate Sophia Left and Sophia Right

Sophia was deigned with lower case character sets in mind, although upper case letters are available.  These 3 font files are identical other than the “Left” having Initial forms (ornaments on the left) and the “Right” terminal forms (ornaments on the right).
In turn, creating decorated word sequences. Start and end your words with a lovely swirl effect. 

This family of fonts is usable in all programs; however, not all programs allow control over manual character spacing. You may find it quite disappointing.

Instructions are specific to AI Illustrator and The Touch Type Tool.
Sophia Left and Right are available in all programs, but will require minor adjustments, if you don't mind a few seconds of extra work, and have the know how, please feel free.  Of course, there are various ways here is one I’ve used.

Illustrator:

1. chose Sophia as you type your word(s)

2. with the Touch Type Tool highlight you first letter, and change the font to Sophia Left.

3. Do the same on the last letter and chose Sophia Right

4. Adjustments if necessary:

Last Letter: with the Touch Type Tool highlight the letter and nudge left using left arrow key

First letter: with the Touch Type Tool highlight the second letter and nudge left


In MS WORD:  

1. chose Sophia as you type your word(s)

2. highlight you first letter, and change the font to Sophia Left.

3. Do the same on the last letter and chose Sophia Right

4. Adjustments if necessary: 

To close a small space between letters highlight the two letters.  In the font format menu under the advanced tab - 
spacing -
choose "condensed" by (number of spaces)  enter your chosen number usually 2-5 depending on the font size.
